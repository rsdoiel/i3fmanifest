# Solr

See the [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr) for instructions on installing Solr or point at the Solr deployment that came with Islandora or ArchivesSpace.

You will need to know the solr admin URL so you can create two base queries for describing the object Ids as well as the query for pulling up specific 
unique records.  In the Islandora Vagrant instance the URL is typically http://localhost/8080/solr/# for accessing the admin interface. The unique
id is the PID field yielding ids in the form of 'islandora:NUMBER' where NUMBER is a incremented row id.

# i3fmanifest

i3manifest is written in Golang with customizations written in JavaScript. This lets you easily adapt the originating Solr source with
the manifests generated by i3fmanifest service.

## Requirements to build i3fmanifest

+ Golang 1.5.x
+ Otto go library
+ A basic knowledge of JavaScript
+ The shape of the JSON responses from Solr
+ Various URLs to get your content
