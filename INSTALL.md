# A search engine

These are notes on a hypothetical IxIF manifest service.

The application assumes some sort of Search engine can provide the links to resources that need a manifest. This might be something like Bleve or an
existing Solr deployment.


# i3fmanifest

i3manifest is written in Golang with customizations written in JavaScript. This lets you easily adapt the originating Solr source with
the manifests generated by i3fmanifest service.

## Requirements to build i3fmanifest

+ Golang 1.6.x
+ [Otto](https://github.com/rsdoiel/otto) fork of [Otto](https://github.com/robertkremin)'s JavaScript VM for go
+ [Bleve](https://blevesearch.com) search engine package for storing and retrieving our manifests
